# WordCloud Creator and Text Analysis


This script creates some user defined functions which form wordclouds and histograsm of the most used words in any file. 
Any type of data can be used as long as the text is in one column. The created functions will create a corpus to clean up the text
(i.e remove punctuation, remove capitalization, and trailing/leading whitespace) as well as remove commonly used words known as stop words.
More stop words can be added through the script if certain words are used quite a bit. I intially created this script to analyze religious
text from the three major Abrahamic religions, so certain old English words were added to the stop word list.
