# Project Portfolio

Hi!

My name is Javid Sultan, I am currently a graduate student at Texas A&M studying Statistics. This GitHub repository contains all of my project, ranging from data visualization, implementing machine learning algorithms, building Neural networks to detect images, etc.

Each project has either a ReadMe which describes the project further or is a Jupyter notebook which will be interactive with commentary and code. A brief summary of each project can be found below. 

If you would like to reach out to me, my email is jsultan100@gmail.com , I hope you enjoy my portfolio!

## **Classification and Regression**

### Model Stacking with Regularized Linear Regression and Tree Methods
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jsultan/Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Regularized%20Linear%20Regression%20and%20Model%20Stacking/Ames_Housing.ipynb)

This project will attempt to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa by stacking regularized linear methods (LASSO, Ridge, ElasticNet) as well as tree methods (RandomForest and gradient boosting) into one model.

This script has gotten me to the top 20% of the Kaggle competition, and the Jupyter notebook will go more into depth how I achieved this score.

### Classifier Boundary Visualizations Using Kernel PCA
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jsultan/Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Visualizing%20Classifier%20Boundaries%20using%20Kernal%20PCA/cancer.ipynb)

This Jupyter notebook will analyze different PCA methods as well as how boundaries are created by different types of classifiers on a dataset describing cancerous tumors. This readMe will be kept short as the notebook goes into further detail. Enjoy!

## **Deep Learning**

### Artificial Neural Network Gender Voice Recognition
[Project Overview](https://github.com/jsultan/Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Artificial%20Neural%20Network%20Gender%20Voice%20Recognition)

This voice classification repository will train eight machine learning algorithms, ranging from K-Nearest Neighbors to Feed Forward Neural Networks, in order classify a voice as being male or female. After these algorithms are trained, any .WAV file can be analyzed and tested on to determine if the voice is male or female.

### Recognizing Cats and Dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jsultan/Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Convolutional%20Neural%20Net%20-%20Dog%20vs%20Cat%20Recognition/CatsAndDogs.ipynb)

The aim of this notebook to is train a CNN to detect if a picture contains a cat or a dog using Keras with a Tensorflow backend. This is one of my first forays into CNN's so this project was intented for me to gain a better understanding of preprocessing, building, and tuning, a convolutional neural network. The data is organized into 8000 pictures evenly split between cats and dogs which is used to train the CNN, and an additional 2000 pictures to use as a validation set. The images are colored, meaning that the input data will have

### Classifying Handwritten Numbers	using a Convolutional Neural Network
[Project Overview](https://github.com/jsultan/Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Convolutional%20Neural%20Net%20-%20Classifying%20Handwritten%20Numbers)

This script creates a convolution neural network in R for the MNIST dataset (currently a competition in kaggle). This dataset contains 28x28 pixel uploaded greyscale images of handwritten numbers ranging from 0 to 1, with each pixel value ranging from 0 to 255. Each number has minor which the CNN attempts to learn and then recognize on the test dataset.

## **Natural Language Processing**

### Classifying User Consumer Satisfaction Based on Resturant Reviews
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jsultan/Project-Portfolio/blob/master/NLP%20-%20Classifying%20Restaurant%20Reviews/NLP%20for%20Restaurant%20Reviews.ipynb)

In this Jupyter notebook, we will carry out some natural language processing on a dataset containing reviews of a certain restaurant. The aim of this NLP task is to classify reviews based on if the reviewer liked the restaurant or not. We will create a Bag-Of-Words model which will break down sentences into its constituent terms. It will then analyze the frequency of used terms along with our target variable, whether or not a review liked the restaurant.


### WordCloud Creator and Text Analysis
[Project Overview](https://github.com/jsultan/Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Text%20Analysis%20and%20Auto%20WordCloud%20Generator)

This project was one of the first I undertook to further my understand of R, as well as understanding basic text analysis. 

This script creates some user defined functions which form word clouds and histograms of the most used words in any file. In this case, I used the function on the three main canonical literature pieces of the Abrahamic faiths (Old Testament, New Testament, and Quran)
