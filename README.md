# Project Portfolio

Hi!

My name is Javid Sultan, I am currently a graduate student at Texas A&M studying Statistics. This GitHub repository contains all of my project, ranging from data visualization, implementing machine learning algorithms, building Neural networks to detect images, etc.

Each project has either a ReadMe which describes the project further or is a Jupyter notebook which will be interactive with commentary and code. A brief summary of each project can be found below. 

If you would like to reach out to me, my email is jsultan100@gmail.com , I hope you enjoy my portfolio!

## Classification and Regression

### Model Stacking with Regularized Linear Regression and Tree Methods
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jsultan/Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Regularized%20Linear%20Regression%20and%20Model%20Stacking/Ames_Housing.ipynb)
This project will attempt to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa by stacking regularized linear methods (LASSO, Ridge, ElasticNet) as well as tree methods (RandomForest and gradient boosting) into one model.

This script has gotten me to the top 20% of the Kaggle competition, and the Jupyter notebook will go more into depth how I achieved this score.

### Classifier Boundary Visualizations Using Kernel PCA
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jsultan/Project-Portfolio/blob/master/Visualizing%20Classifier%20Boundaries%20using%20Kernal%20PCA/cancer.ipynb)
This Jupyter notebook will analyze different PCA methods as well as how boundaries are created by different types of classifiers on a dataset describing cancerous tumors. This readMe will be kept short as the notebook goes into further detail. Enjoy!

## Natural Language Processing

### WordCloud Creator and Text Analysis

This project was one of the first I undertook to further my understand of R, as well as understanding basic text analysis. 

This script creates some user defined functions which form word clouds and histograms of the most used words in any file. In this case, I used the function on the three main canonical literature pieces of the Abrahamic faiths (Old Testament, New Testament, and Quran)

### Classifying User Consumer Satisfaction Based on Resturant Reviews
