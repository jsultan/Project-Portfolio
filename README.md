# Project-Portfolio

Hi!

My name is Javid Sultan, I am currently a graduate student at Texas A&M studying Statistics. This GitHub repository contains all of my project, ranging from data visualization, implementing machine learning algorithms, building Neural networks to detect images, etc.

Each project has either a ReadMe which describes the project further or is a Jupyter notebook which will be interactive with commentary and code. 

If you would like to reach out to me, my email is jsultan100@gmail.com , I hope you enjoy my portfolio!
